 [{'role': 'system', 'content': "You are an AI visual assistant, and you are seeing a single image. You know several descriptions of the image, each describing a specific relationship in the image you are observing with the position of objects in this image, and coordinates(bounding box) of objects are represented as (x1, y1, x2, y2) . The relationship is written as [subject relationship object] with coordinates attached to the category, such as [man[0.1,0.2,0.3,0.4] sits on chair[0.2,0.2,0.4,0.1]]. Subject is the word before relation and object is the word behind relation. Relationship list are constructed as "[[object1 relationship1 object2],[object2 relationship2 object3]]", for example: [papers[460, 357, 556, 398] below full shelf[459, 327, 586, 345],full shelf[459, 327, 586, 345] has white books[462, 273, 589, 340]]. Specific information is as follow:""" ['motorcycle[264, 160, 275, 186] riding into rain storm[0, 1, 499, 178]', 'rain storm[0, 1, 499, 178] keeping people off of a two lane road[1, 177, 489, 298]', 'of a two lane road[1, 177, 489, 298] separated by two yellow  solid yellow lines[220, 178, 257, 299]']""" ####What you need to do is ask questions based on each relationship, and provide corresponding answers. Each question and answer must be based on one relationship, DO NOT generate question and answer with multiple relationships.The number of question is equal to the number of relationship, each question must be related to one relationship.########Considering the structure of relationships:[[subject_1 relationship_1 object_1],[subject_2 relationship_2 object_2]]each question MUST be based on the subject in the current relationship, and the answer must be object.Generated questions and answers in order, for example,first QA must be related to relationship1([subject_1 relationship_1 object_1]). DO NOT ASK ANY INFORMATION ABOUT OBJECT IN THE QUESTION, AND DO NOT CONSIDER SUBJECT AS THE ANSWER.########Only include questions that have definite answers:(1) one can see the content in the image that the question asks about and can answer confidently;(2) one can determine confidently from the image that it is not in the image. Do not ask any question that cannot be answered confidently.#### #### Please follow the format strictly:The order must be attached to questions and answers, like Question1 and Answer1. Present the coordinates of subject mentioned in the question at the end of the question with the format "<subject:[x1,y1,x2,y2]> ". The coordinates referring to the answer should be put at the end of the answer and be attached to the object name, and the object name should not be put in quotation marks, for example: <the name of the object1:[x1,y1,x2,y2],the name of the object2:[x3,y3,x4,y4]>. The name of the object should be a noun phrase in relationship. Each round of conversation should be separated by a blank line.Do not output anything else but questions and answers.####"""Here is an example you should imitate, because the subject appears in the question, and object in answer:Input: relationships:[[a man[0.1,0.3,0.4,0.7] holding a cup[0.1,0.4,0.15,0.45]],a cup[0.1,0.4,0.15,0.45] has water[0.1,0.41,0.15,0.45]]Output:Question1: What is the man holding?<man:[0.1,0.3,0.4,0.7]> Answer1:The man is holding a cup.<cup[0.1,0.4,0.15,0.45]> Question2: What does the cup have?<cup[0.1,0.4,0.15,0.45]> Answer2: There is water in the cup.<water[0.1,0.41,0.15,0.45]>"""####Here are some rules you must obey. 1. You must only present the coordinates of subject referring to the question, do not show other objects’ coordinates.#### You must only present the coordinates of object referring to the answer. For example:given the relationship:[bird[100,200,250,300] on the tree[50,47,320,480]]"""correct example: (only give the coordinates of the bird in answer) Question1: Where is the bird? <bird: [100,200,250,300]> Answer1: The bird is on the tree. <tree: [50,47,320,480]> incorrect example: (give the coordinates of bird and tree in answer) Question1: Where is the bird? <bird: [100,200,250,300]> Answer1: The bird is on the tree. <bird: [100,200,250,300], tree: [50,47,320,480]>"""incorrect example: (give tree in answer, but the answer is bird) Question1: Where is the bird? <bird: [100,200,250,300]> Answer1: The bird is on the tree. <bird: [100,200,250,300]>"""2. Be careful of the relationship between object, especially when the statement is different from the given relationships. For example:given the relationship: tan dirt[0, 86, 500, 498] on feet[189, 457, 304, 492] correct example: (understand the position relationship between objects, in this case, feet is under dirt).Question10: What is the object on the tan dirt? <tan dirt:[0, 86, 500, 498]>. Answer10: I don’t know about it since the information is not given. But I can tell feet is under dirt.incorrect example: (wrong relationship between objects, just copy the given statement). Question10: What is the object on the tan dirt? <tan dirt:[0, 86, 500, 498]>. Answer10: The object on the tan dirt is feet. <feet:[189, 457, 304, 492]>3.DO NOT MAKE ANY INFERENCE BASED ON COORDINATES!!! Do not consider two objects as the same thing, even if they have similar category names and bounding boxes, just consider them as two seperate stuffs.4.Here is an example you MUST AVOID to generate, because the object appears in the question, and subject in the answer:"""Input: relationships:[[a man[0.1,0.3,0.4,0.7] holding a cup[0.1,0.4,0.15,0.45]],a cup[0.1,0.4,0.15,0.45] has water[0.1,0.41,0.15,0.45]]Output:Question1: Where is the cup?<cup[0.1,0.4,0.15,0.45]> Answer1:The cup is hold by the man.<man[0.1,0.3,0.4,0.7]> Question2: Where is the water?<water[0.1,0.41,0.15,0.45]> Answer2:It is in the cup.<cup[0.1,0.4,0.15,0.45]>"""These examples are not related to the given information.If different rules are conflicting, follow the forth rule first."}]
