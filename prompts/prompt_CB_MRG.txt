What you need to do is ask 7 new questions in order with the modified relationships generated in former task, each based on the answer to the previous question, and provide corresponding answers. The questions can be relative position between objects, the relationship between objects, object action, object attributes, object status, object types, etc. 
Only include questions that have definite answers:(1) one can see the content in the image that the question asks about and can answer confidently;(2) one can determine confidently from the image that it is not in the image. Do not ask any question that cannot be answered confidently.
Please note that each question must refer to an object or some objects in the image, if this requirement can not be satisfied, replace this question with another. In addition, please follow the format strictly: Present the coordinates of every object mentioned in the question at the end of each question with the format "<object:[x1,y1,x2,y2]>". The order must be attached to questions and answers, like Question1 and Answer1. The coordinates referring to the answer should be put at the end of the answer and be attached to the object name, and the object name should not be put in quotation marks, for example: <the name of the object1:[x1,y1,x2,y2],the name of the object2:[x3,y3,x4,y4]>. The name of the object should be a noun phrase in relationship. Each round of conversation should be separated by a blank line.
Here is an example:
Question1: What is the color of the shirt of the man? <man:[0.1,0.1,0.3,0.5],shirt:[0.1,0.2,0.3,0.4]>
Answer1: The color is red. <shirt:[0.1,0.2,0.3,0.4]>

Question2: Where is the man sitting? <man:[0.1,0.1,0.3,0.5]>
Answer2: The man is sitting on a chair. <chair:[0.1,0.4,0.3,0.6]>

This example is not related to the given information.
Here are some cases and requirements you must pay attention to.
1. If you think the bounding box or some expressions given in the question directly reveals the answer, do not present this information in the question. Here are some cases, while more examples are not given.####(1)	If the answer is about the attribute (such as color, shape, motion, etc) of an object, present bounding boxes of all objects. For example: 
 """correct example: (ask the color of the object, present all object) Question1: What is the color of the bird on the tree? <bird: [100,200,250,300], tree: [50,47,320,480]>Answer1: The color of the bird on the tree is brown. <bird: [100,200,250,300]> 
incorrect example: (the coordinates of the tree mentioned in the question is not given) Question1: What is the color of the bird on the tree? <tree: [50,47,320,480] > Answer1: The color of the bird on the tree is brown. <bird: [100,200,250,300]>"""
(2)	If the question aims to locate an object, do not give the coordinates of this object, unless there are some objects that can’t be distinguished without coordinates.For example: 
"""correct example: (not present the bounding box of the object as the answer) Question1: Is the white cup on the right of the man? <man :[99,40,201,220]> Answer1: No, the white cup is on the left of the man. <cup: [25,100,51,124]> 
incorrect example: (present the bounding box of the object as the answer) Question1: Is the white cup on the right of the man? <man :[99,40,201,220], white cup: [25,100,51,124]> Answer1: No, the white cup is on the left of the man. <white cup: [25,100,51,124]>"""
(3)	If the detailed description in the question directly reveals the answer (so you do not have to search for answer in the relationships information), do not present this information in the question. For example: 
"""correct example: (not present the bounding box of the object as the answer) Question1: Where is the white car? <white car: [99,100,300,220]> Answer1: The white car is parking on the street. <street: [71,194,410,301]> 
incorrect example: (not present the bounding box of the object as the answer) Question1: Where is the white car parking on the street? <car: [99,100,300,220], street: [71,194,410,301]> Answer1: The car is parking on the street. <street: [71,194,410,301]>"""
2. You must only present the coordinates of object to the question, do not show other objects’ coordinates. For example:
"""correct example: (only give the coordinates of the bird) Question1: What is the color of the bird on the tree? <bird: [100,200,250,300], tree: [50,47,320,480]> Answer1: The color of the bird on the tree is brown. <bird: [100,200,250,300]> 
incorrect example: (give the coordinates of bird and tree) Question1: What is the color of the bird on the tree? <bird: [100,200,250,300], tree: [50,47,320,480]> Answer1: The color of the bird on the tree is brown. <bird: [100,200,250,300], tree: [50,47,320,480]>"""
3. If some objects can be the answer to the question, list them all in the answer. Attention, these objects may occur in different relationships. For example:
given information: pedal[337, 388, 358, 409] on black bicycle[168, 211, 479, 483] ; wheel[365, 317, 479, 484] on black bicycle[168, 211, 479, 483]; spokes[371, 325, 469, 474] on wheel[365, 317, 479, 484]
"""correct example: Question5: What is the object on the black bicycle? <black bicycle:[168, 211, 479, 483]>Answer5: The objects on the black bicycle are a chain, a pedal, a wheel with spokes, and a smiling and hanging out girl is leaning on it. <pedal:[337, 388, 358, 409], wheel:[365, 317, 479, 484], spokes:[371, 325, 469, 474] >. Reason: list all objects on black bicycle with a specific position, especially include spokes, because the wheel[365, 317, 479, 484] spokes on is on black bicycle[168, 211, 479, 483], which means spokes is on bicycle."""
"""incorrect example: Reason: only list a part of objects on the black bicycle, not only miss the objects that has direct relationship (wheel), but miss the objects that has indirect relationship (spokes) Question5: What is the object on the black bicycle? <black bicycle:[168, 211, 479, 483]>. Answer5: The objects on the black bicycle are a chain, a pedal, a wheel with spokes, and a smiling and hanging out girl is leaning on it. <pedal:[337, 388, 358, 409], wheel:[365, 317, 479, 484], spokes:[371, 325, 469, 474] >"""4. Try to avoid complex inference about the relationships, if you are not certain about the answer, do not ask this question.
5. If the answer is not corresponding to object in the image, do not output any bounding box.
6. If the answer is 'the information is not given', replace the expression with 'I do not know'.
7. Be careful of the relationship between objects, especially when the statement in question is different from the given relationships. For example:
given relationship: tan dirt[0, 86, 500, 498] on feet[189, 457, 304, 492] 
correct example: (understand the position relationship between object, in this case, feet is under dirt).Question10: What is the object on the tan dirt? <tan dirt:[0, 86, 500, 498]>. Answer10: I don’t know about it since the information is not given. But I can tell feet is under dirt.
incorrect example: (wrong relationship between objects, just copy the given statement). Question10: What is the object on the tan dirt? <tan dirt:[0, 86, 500, 498]>. Answer10: The object on the tan dirt is feet. <feet:[189, 457, 304, 492]>
8.DO NOT MAKE ANY INFERENCE BASED ON COORDINATES!!! Do not consider two objects as the same thing, even if they have similar category names and bounding boxes, just consider them as two seperate stuffs."}]
